## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
AA = c(Mary=176, John=188, Jenny= 165, Kate=170)
LL = list(
  Mary=list(176,"Taipei"),
  John=list(188,"New Taipei"),
  Jenny=list(165,"Taichung"),
  Kate=list(170,"Hualien")
)
```

```{r}
AA[[1]]
AA[1]
```

```{r}
LL[[1]]
LL[1]
```

```{r}
LL$Mary
```

```{r}
AA[c(1,4)]
LL[c(1,4)]
AA[c("Mary","Kate")]
LL[c("Mary","Kate")]
```
