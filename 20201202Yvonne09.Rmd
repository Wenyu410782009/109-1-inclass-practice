## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
set.seed(2020)
ages_chr <- sample(c("4以下","5-10","11-15"), 15, replace=T)
ages_chr
```

```{r}
unique(ages_chr)
```

```{r}
table(ages_chr)
```

```{r}
ages_fct1 <- 
  factor(
    ages_chr
  )
```

```{r}
table(ages_fct1)
table(ages_chr)
```

```{r}
ages_fct2 <- 
  factor(
    ages_chr,
    levels = c("4以下","5-10","11-15")
  )
```
```{r}
table(ages_fct1)
table(ages_fct2)
```
